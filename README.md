# IP_Subnetting
why I created this:
1. frustration with manual subnetting calculations.
2. manual addition of binary numbers makes a number of people confused
3. if you are still in school, calculations like this are usually equipped with a calculation method. You don't have to worry because this program is equipped with simple and sensible calculation methods
4. if you want to develop this. Please download the source code and develop it thanks ...
